# HPC WORKSHOP 

This is my first file in the whole git world. To a greater world and and higher rank.

First HW is an openMP code which is usable only on shared memory. So it is not frequently 
used for HPCs, but it can help in running parallel programs on PCs and local machines. 

Second HW is an example of using blocking point to point data communication using MPI-send and
MPI-recv.
