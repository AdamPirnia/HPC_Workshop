# HPC WORKSHOP 

This is my first file in the whole git world. To a greater world and and higher rank.

HW1 is an openMP code which is usable only on shared memory. So it is not frequently 
used for HPCs, but it can help in running parallel programs on PCs and local machines. 

HW2 is an example of using blocking point to point data communication using MPI-send and
MPI-recv. In HW22, master process gets data from all others and prints them in order.
